    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hey there! I'm Didiegons — a curious mind with a passion for technology, precision, and a little bit of speed! With a background rooted in problem-solving and forward-thinking, I thrive at the intersection of structure and creativity. I enjoy diving into projects that challenge convention, push boundaries, and make life just a little smarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work closely with developers to build more secure software by making security part of the conversation early. I lead hands-on training sessions and secure code review workshops that help teams spot vulnerabilities, write safer code, and confidently defend their apps. It's not just about fixing bugs — it's about building a security-first mindset that sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not improving code or mentoring devs, you’ll find me serving aces on the tennis court, glued to the thrill of Formula 1 and MotoGP, or enjoying the strategy-packed world of 20 and 50-over cricket matches. My work philosophy? Stay sharp, move fast, and always leave room for a good laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it’s collaborating on meaningful projects or building tools that spark joy and efficiency, I bring passion, adaptability, and just the right amount of competitive spirit. Let’s connect and make something awesome together!
