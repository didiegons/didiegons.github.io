        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Didiegons — a curious mind with a passion for technology, precision, and a little bit of speed! With a background rooted in problem-solving and forward-thinking, I thrive at the intersection of structure and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work closely with developers to build more secure software by making security part of the conversation early. I lead hands-on training sessions and secure code review workshops that help teams spot vulnerabilities, write safer code, and confidently defend their apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not improving code or mentoring devs, you’ll find me serving aces on the tennis court, glued to the thrill of Formula 1 and MotoGP, or enjoying the strategy-packed world of 20 and 50-over cricket matches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether it’s collaborating on meaningful projects or building tools that spark joy and efficiency, I bring passion, adaptability, and just the right amount of competitive spirit.
        </p>

        <h3>Meet Dayo — Your Cybersecurity Ally</h3>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m Dayo — an Information Protection Advisor with a background in cybersecurity, forensic accounting, and a love for simplifying the complex. I’ve seen firsthand how confusing and intimidating cybersecurity can be for small business owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why I created <strong>AI Shield</strong> — a platform that delivers calm, clear, AI-supported protection you can actually use. My goal is to help business owners like you secure your data, build trust with customers, and sleep better at night.
        </p>

        <h4>Why I Created AI Shield</h4>
        <p>
          Most cybersecurity tools are built for IT teams. They’re packed with jargon, complex dashboards, and expensive features. But small business owners deserve protection too — and they deserve to understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>AI Shield is built for you.</strong><br>
          Simple tools. Practical checklists. And smart, AI-powered support that makes staying safe feel possible.
        </p>

        <h4>Connect With Me</h4>
        <p>
